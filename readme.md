Oftalco is made to determine which disease may an user have depending on a set of symptoms (we focus the project in diseases regarding the eyes), it uses a knowledge database described in the file **facts** file, it also uses tkinter to generate a graphical user interface, with some entries, frames, buttons and labels. Rules were omited as only one assertion describe the entire set of rules, the **yes** predicate its able to store all necesary info.
